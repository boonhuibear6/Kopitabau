              Our matcha is shade-grown in Japan and stone-milled using traditional methods. It's third-party tested for purity, completely vegan, and contains no added sugar or artificial ingredients. We prioritize quality and authenticity in every cup.

            <AccordionContent>

          <AccordionItem value="item-3">
            <AccordionTrigger>What are the health benefits of matcha?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Matcha is rich in antioxidants, particularly EGCG, which supports immune health. It provides clean, sustained energy without the jitters from coffee, promotes calm focus thanks to L-theanine, and supports metabolism and overall wellness.
